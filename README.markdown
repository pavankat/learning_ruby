I finished the The Fundamentals of Ruby course on tutsplus.com.

I'm currently doing the Test-Driven Development in Ruby course.

These aren't my code samples. I just have my code here because 
they're my notes that I took while doing the course. I'm going
to use these notes to become a better rubyist.
